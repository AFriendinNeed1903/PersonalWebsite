        <h1>Universities Have Abandoned More Than $1 Million Dollars of Property in Texas</h1>
        <p class="author">Written by <a href="https://altmejd.org/">Adam Altmejd</a></p>
        <p class="date">11/29/2024</p>

        <h3>Background: What is Unclaimed Property?</h3>
        <p>If someone cuts you a cashier's check for $100 and sends it to you in the mail, and the mail truck catches fire… what happens to the $100?</p>
        <p>In the United States, what happens is that eventually the bank which guarantees the cashier's check will turn the value of that check over to the custody of the state government. From the Texas Comptroller’s Office:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>What is Unclaimed Property?</strong></p>
            <p>Since 1963, Texas has required institutions, businesses and governmental entities to report to the state any personal property that has been unclaimed for up to five years, depending on the property in question.</p>
            <p>Unclaimed property can be abandoned assets. Some examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>dividend, payroll or cashier's checks</li>
                <li>stocks, bonds or mutual fund accounts</li>
                <li>utility deposits and other refunds</li>
                <li>bank accounts and safe deposit box contents</li>
                <li>insurance proceeds</li>
                <li>mineral interest or royalty payments</li>
                <li>court deposits, trust funds or escrow accounts</li>
                <li>overpayments on insurance, utilities and other bills</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>So if you have a bank account in the state of Texas and leave it untouched for a few years, when it eventually gets closed down the bank will send whatever's left in to the Texas Comptroller’s office for safe-keeping. Every state handles these claims slightly differently, but nearly all of them have a website set up like Texas’ <a href="http://www.claimittexas.gov">www.claimittexas.gov</a> where you can search your surname or business name for any property you’re owed.</p>
        <p>I learned about this myself just a few weeks ago in David Quintanilla’s Business Law class at the University of Texas. At the end of our class on property law, he had us search for property in our name as an exercise. He told us that, every semester somebody always finds some astonishing amount of money under their name. Plenty of people find $25, sometimes they find a couple hundred. One semester he even had a student find $80,000 which belonged to her late father-in-law! After I learned that, I spent around an hour a day searching through the website to see what I could find. I searched family members, friends, colleagues, public figures. So far I’ve uncovered around $10,000 total for the folks in my life. I found myself wishing that I could get everyone’s attention all at once and ask them to search for themselves instead of having to look on my own. Hopefully that’s what I’ve done with this article.</p>

        <h3>So? Tell me about the “$1 MILLION DOLLARS” from that flashy headline!</h3>
        <p>When you search “University of Texas” on <a href="http://www.claimittexas.gov">www.claimittexas.gov</a>, you’re immediately greeted with a page full of items with values of more than $100. When I saw that one of the first results was a $15,000, I nearly fell out of my chair! But that $15k is the least of it… all in all, the University of Texas System has nearly $300,000 dollars in unclaimed property once you add up all their unclaimed items.</p>
        <p>But it’s not just UT. Searching through the data, I was able to find over $1 Million dollars waiting to be claimed from the State of Texas by various universities both within and outside Texas. This includes some big ticket items like one claim worth $31,457.45 for Rice University which has been waiting since 2006, a claim of $39,313.98 for the University of North Texas, or $21,698.98 for the University of Washington. To be clear, while those are particularly large individual unclaimed items, each of those universities has even MORE money waiting to be claimed in smaller items as well. At last count, my dataset had over 600 different unclaimed items worth $100 dollars or less.</p>
        <p>I’ve attached my (very limited) dataset <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cRRR6cQC9uewxPr3xiPE7yFcx159jxfm/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110843073219208151285&rtpof=true&sd=true">here</a> if you’d like to take a look for yourself, or go to <a href="http://www.claimittexas.gov">www.claimittexas.gov</a> and take a look at the source yourself.</p>
